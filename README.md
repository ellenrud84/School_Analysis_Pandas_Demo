# School District Analysis Pandas Demo:

In this example I assist a fictional school board and mayor to make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

First the district-wide standardized test results are analyzed. The data includes very student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Using pandas, I aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

## Methods:
The Pandas python library and a Jupyter Notebook are used to perform the analysis.
You must submit a link to your Jupyter Notebook with the viewable Data Frames.
You must include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.
See Example Solution for a reference on the expected format.

A report is created that includes:

### District Summary: 
A high level snapshot (in table form) of the district's key metrics, including:

  * Total Schools
  * Total Students
  * Total Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)

### School Summary: 
An overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:

  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per Student Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)


### Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing): 
A table highlighting the top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing, including:

  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per Student Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)


### Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing): 
A table highlighting the bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Includes all the same metrics as above


 ### Math Scores by Grade: 
 A table that lists the average Math Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.


### Reading Scores by Grade: 
A table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.


### Scores by School Spending: 
A table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student). Uses 4 bins to group school spending. Table includes the following:

  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.)
  * % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.)
  * % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)

### Scores by School Size: 
Repeats the above breakdown, but this time schools are groups based on school size (Small, Medium, Large).


### Scores by School Type: 
Repeats the above breakdown, but this time schools are grouped based on school type (Charter vs. District).
